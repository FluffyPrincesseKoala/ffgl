Fork of [Resolume FFGL plugin](https://github.com/resolume/ffgl) repo.

# FFGL Raymarching Plugin Collection
Welcome to the FFGL Raymarching Plugin Collection, a work-in-progress suite of raymarching plugins forked from the Resolume SDK. This project aims to provide basic raymarching visual effects for VJs and visual artists using Resolume Arena and Avenue.

# Features

## Basic Raymarching Techniques
implement fundamental raymarching algorithms to create simple 3D scenes and patterns. This project is an ongoing effort to learn and apply raymarching techniques, and it is continuously evolving as new techniques are explored.

## Integration with Resolume
Built on the Resolume SDK, thoses plugins are designed to work with Resolume Arena and Avenue. However, due to the limited documentation available for FFGL, some aspects of the user interface and integration may not be fully polished at the moment.

## Customizable Parameters
While still in development, the plugins offer a few parameters that can be adjusted to modify the visual effects. More customization options and plugins will be added as the project progresses.

# Installation
